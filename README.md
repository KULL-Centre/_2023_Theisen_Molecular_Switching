# Data Description #
- NMR
  - DREB2A NMR data contains CEST profiles in a raw format. WT DREB2A was recorded using 500 µM DREB2A and 25 µM Med25ACID. Carbon CEST profiles were recorded at 25 °C.
  - Med25ACID NMR data contains chemical shifts of the unbound state and D2a titrations, relaxation rates and hetNOEs. Assignment and titration data was obtained at 25 °C at pH 6.5 using BestTrosy pulse sequences.
- ITC
  - Raw .itc files are provided. Concentrations given in file should be correct.
  - Spolar Record structuring analysis data is also provided in an Excel file.
- Stopped-flow
  - Contains raw fluorescence traces. Indicated concentrations are post mixing concentations.
  - Contains observed rate constants.
- SAXS
  - Buffer subtracted scattering curve of Med25ACID_532-680 obtained from SEC-SAXS.
- MD
  - 1.7 µs trajectory snapshots at 0.5 ns intervals.
- AF2
  - Contains all three models discussed in the paper.
  - Contains a cis proline version model 2, obtained through a 10 ns MD simulation.
- Bioinformatics
  - AD scores for DREB2A tiles
  - Alignment of DREB2A used to obtain the ABS motif. Some sequences were removed in the paper representation to reduce visual size of alignment.
  - Alignment of plant Med25ACID domains used for surface residue evolutional conservation.
